This is code created for a tutorial for the ElixirDose.com website.

It is the second part of a series, and I'm writing the code long before I actually write the tutorial.  Let's hope something comes of this.

There are no dependencies.  This code was created with Erlang 16B02 and Elixir 0.11.3-dev

## Update January 3, 2014 

Program now runs. There's an off by one error near the end I need to fix.  And I think there's likely a failing test to be rewritten.  But it does seem to work.  Tomorrow starts the long process of cleaning it up and learning from everything.  There's a lot of work left to do...

## TODO: 

Add all the functionality needed to create a card game. Game play mechanics, card comparisons, dealing out cards, etc.

## TO RUN:

I've been running it from inside `iex`.  Go with `Games.play_a_game` and let 'er rip.  It's ugly, but it works.
