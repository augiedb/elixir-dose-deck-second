This is code created for a tutorial for the ElixirDose.com website.

It is the second part of a series, and I'm writing the code long before I actually write the tutorial.  Let's hope something comes of this.

There are no dependencies.  This code was created with Erland 16B02 and Elixir 0.11.3-dev

** TODO: **

Add all the functionality needed to create a card game. Game play mechanics, card comparisons, dealing out cards, etc.
